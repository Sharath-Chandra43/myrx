We are given two arrays that represent the arrival and departure times of trains, the
task is to find the minimum number of platforms required so that no train waits.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = {9:00, 9:40, 9:50, 11:00, 15:00, 18:00}, dep[] = {9:10, 12:00, 11:20, 11:30,
19:00, 20:00}
Output: 3
Explanation: There are at-most three trains at a time (time between 9:40 to 12:00)

Input: arr[] = {9:00, 9:40}, dep[] = {9:10, 12:00}
Output: 1
Explanation: Only one platform is needed.

def min_platforms(arr, dep):
    arr.sort()
    dep.sort()
    
    n = len(arr)
    i, j = 0, 0  \
    platforms_needed, max_platforms = 0, 0

    while i < n and j < n:
        if arr[i] < dep[j]:  
            platforms_needed += 1
            max_platforms = max(max_platforms, platforms_needed)
            i += 1
        else:  # A train departs
            platforms_needed -= 1
            j += 1

    return max_platforms

arr = [900, 940, 950, 1100, 1500, 1800]  
dep = [910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000]

print(min_platforms(arr, dep))
